description: As part of my Senior Capstone project, my team worked with <a href="http://www.care.com">Care.com</a> to develop a way for seniors to age-in-place for longer with a higher quality of life. Throughout the year, we interviewed dozens of seniors, families, caregivers, and senior care experts to get a deeper understanding of the aging experience. With that, we generated hundreds of potential ideas of which five were further explored through looks-like prototypes and co-designs. After several iterations, we built a mobile prototype of Orbit, an app to increase intergenerational communication and alleviate the loneliness felt by seniors. Unfortunately, the majority of the project remains under NDA (hence the complete lack of any specific information), but you can see a public-facing poster from our presentation <a href="http://www.olin.edu/sites/default/files/carecomarchivalposter.pdf"> here</a>.
