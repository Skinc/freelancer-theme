description: "I spent the summer of 2015 working at the Tech Studio, the department in the Boston Museum of Science that runs design challenges and hands-on introductions to different types of technology. Throughout the summer, I ran daily design challenges and as well as facilitated a variety of activities to introduce museum visitors to different aspects of computer science. 
 <br/>
 <br/> My major project involved KIBO, an educational robot that introduces young children to computer science using wooden blocks and a bar code scanner to program the robot. The robot and accompanying curriculum were designed for long-term play for users 4-7, but it was used on the floor with guests between 4 and 40 years old for 10-15 minutes at a time. To make things more complicated, the facilitators running these activities usually had little computer science experience so they would simply explain how to use the robot and then let the visitors mess around for a few minutes before getting bored and moving on. 
 <br/>
 <br/> After some play, I realized that the robots were quite capable of handling more complicated code. On a whim, I thought of a few challenges for visitors to give them a goal to accomplish. Quickly, it became clear visitors could go from never having coded to designing algorithms for the KIBO to explore the floor or simulate driving in traffic. I developed a range of challenges for visitors of all ages and experience levels and wrote a packet including all the challenges so any volunteer could take a KIBO on the floor and effectively introduce visitors to computer science. 
 <br/>
 <br/> The challenges started out simple, with visitor making the KIBO act in certain ways. Next, visitors could start to design simple algorithms to have the robot move in a square or wait for user input before doing a certain activity. One level higher, the challenges had visitors, who 10 minutes earlier had never coded, thinking about edge cases and nesting loops. My proudest challenges, though, were designed to have the visitors use the block commands to write out programs that couldnâ€™t be accomplished by simply ordering the blocks (like all other challenges could be). This allowed visitors to make the jump from playing with blocks to designing and writing out a program that could be given to the KIBO.
My work is still being used almost daily and multiple science museums have reached out to the Tech Studio to have access to my KIBO curriculum.
