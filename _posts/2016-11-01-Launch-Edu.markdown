description: "In October 2016, a friend and I took over Launch Edu. 
<br/>
 <br/>
Launch Edu aims to engage and empower students from all backgrounds by equipping them with the entrepreneurial skills necessary to start and run their own profitable businesses. The program fosters an experiential learning environment by prioritizing creation and iteration, and gives students the opportunity to make sales from day one.
 <br/>
 <br/> Students use tools and resources from the program and their everyday lives to build and sell products in their schools, communities, and online. By pitching their ideas to strangers on the street, approaching others for feedback, and striking partnerships with local businesses, students have the experience of succeeding with the support of their community. They walk away with the confidence that they can create opportunities for themselves. Please reach out to me if you'd like to learn more."
