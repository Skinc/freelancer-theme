description: Over the years, I've launched 5 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_balloon">high altitude balloons</a>. High altitude ballooning is an exhilirating, awe-inspiring hobby. I first got into high altitude ballooning in 2012 as a project for my Real World Measurements course. That first balloon drifted a little off course and landed in the ocean, leading to <a href="https://www.mvtimes.com/2012/05/16/edgartown-fisherman-finds-mysterious-box-sea-10686/">quite an adventure</a>. I was hooked. From the balloon that landed in swamp without cell service (and took 4 years to be recovered) to the balloon that landed 80 feet up a tree in someone's backyard (and is still waiting for us to figure out how to retrieve it), each balloon has had its own, unique challenge.  <br/> <br/> <img src="img/portfolio/resources/space.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered"> <img src="img/portfolio/resources/rainbow.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered"> <img src="img/portfolio/resources/lowalt.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered"> <img src="img/portfolio/resources/prelaunch.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered"> <img src="img/portfolio/resources/undershot.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered">
