description: In January 2013, I took a short video of teams being announced for a class I was in. That video was the start of a project I never expected to last a year, let alone four. Almost everyday since then, I’ve taken videos of my friends, my food, places I’ve been, art I’ve seen and so much more. The project was inspired by this <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/cesar_kuriyama_one_second_every_day"> Ted Talk </a>. After 4 years, I've compliled two videos into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tixt-T2mh3A"> the full 48 minute version </a> and <a  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIjCIPn1I64">a collection of my favorite seconds</a>. In the collection, each of the clips in this has something that makes it special to me. Some are an especially cherished memory. Some are beautiful views. Some have funny audio. Some have a funny story around me taking the video. Each has a reason it was specifically chosen (feel free to ask why).
