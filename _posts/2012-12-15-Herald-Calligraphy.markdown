description: As part of Olin's Principles of Engineering class, my team and I built a calligraphy writing machine. Our machine has precise three-axis control. It uses a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to input and format text. These inputs are then processed and passed to our microcontroller, which directs our stepper motors to produce the strokes that form text. You can learn more at our <a href="http://calligraphybyherald.wixsite.com/herald">project site</a>. You can also check out writeups on <a href="http://hackaday.com/2013/03/08/handwriting-suck-build-a-machine-to-do-it-for-you/">hackaday</a> and <a href="http://www.techhive.com/article/2030519/this-robot-has-better-handwriting-than-you-do-and-other-stuff-you-missed-.html">TechHive</a>. <p></p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E9bdaHhcjR4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
