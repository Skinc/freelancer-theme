description: In Spring 2012, 2 friends and I joined forces to found Three Chocolatiers, our small-scale chocolate business. Over the next year, we perfected our chocolate-making process using kitchen appliances and started a subscription chocolate service with over 50 customers. We invented and refined a dozen unique flavors. Our most successful flavors were Apple Pie, Sesame Wasabi, and Captain Crunch. Our least successfl flavors were Cheddar and Spinach Black Pepper.
