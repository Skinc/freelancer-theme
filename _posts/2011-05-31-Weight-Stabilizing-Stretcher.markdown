description: During high school, I worked with 3 friends to design, prototype and patent a weight-stabilizing backboard for search and rescue missions. During search and rescue missions, the injured person sometimes needs to be carried for miles over rough terrain while strapped tightly to a backboard. This experience can cause discomfort and significant injuries. Our design stabilizes the weight so the person has a more comfortable, safe experience. To fund this project, we were chosen twice to be Lemelson-MIT Inventeams and presented at MIT's EurekaFest. I designed, CADed, fabricated, and tested 3 prototypes, worked with patent attorneys to on the patent application, and developed a supplemental harness system.
